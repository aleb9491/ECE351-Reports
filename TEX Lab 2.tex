%Quastions 1, 2, and 3:

%1. No they'er not identical because when spyder diffrentiates the funtion f(t) between tow virtical points it finds the result as infinity and draws the derivative according to that.

%2. If we use a larger size the plot will change because larger step size causes less accuracy.

%3. In the begining it's looks understandable, but it's take me a while to know what exactly i have to do. That not because of the lab tasks No, i think that because of the tow languges English is my second language and i'm not good on Spyder (Python),TEX.
